description: 'Genomic data refers to the genome and DNA data of an organism. They are used in bioinformatics for collecting, storing and processing the genomes of living things. Genomic data is a more extensive term than sequencing data and however genomic data mostly come from sequencing techniques. It may include non-sequencing data such as data from microarrays, data from real-time PCR panels and data from pharmacogenomics studies.
