description: "Pre-print describes the first draft of the article - before\r peer-review, even before any contact with a publisher. This use is common amongst academics for whom the key modification of an article is the peer-review process.\r \r Another use of the term pre-print is for the finished article, reviewed and amended, ready and accepted for publication - but separate from the version that is type-set or formatted by the publisher. This use is more common amongst publishers, for whom the final and significant stage of modification to an article is the arrangement of the material for putting to print.
