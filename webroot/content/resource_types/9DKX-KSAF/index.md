title: utility model
uri: http://purl.org/coar/resource_type/9DKX-KSAF
description: 'A special form of patent right granted by a state or jurisdiction to an inventor or the inventor’s assignee for a fixed period of time. The terms and conditions for granting a utility model are slightly different from those for normal patents (including a shorter term of protection and less stringent patentability requirements). The term can also describe what are known in certain countries as “petty patents,” “short-term patents” or “innovation patents.” [Source: https://www.wipo.int/edocs/pubdocs/en/wipo_pub_943_2018.pdf]'
