description: |-
    Physical samples include biological specimens, rock or mineral specimens, soil or sediment cores, plants and seeds, water quality samples, archaeological artefacts, or DNA and human tissue samples. Samples may be used in analyses and can be destroyed in this process, whereas specimens are preserved curated objects that can be continuously studied.
